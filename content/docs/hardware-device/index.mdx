# Questions and Advice for SentryAI Device

## Questions

- What if someone jumps through windows?
- Blurriness, covering hoods, image technicalities?
- Potential errors through USB camera and mic connection?
- Image compression concerns.
- Identifying sounds similar to gunshots.
- USB C range extender feasibility?
- Power over Ethernet capabilities?

## Advice

- Implement the system throughout the entire building, not just in specific areas.
- Focus on both facial and threat recognition.
- Ensure resiliency through minimal moving parts.
- Be cautious of potential errors through USB connections.
- Prioritize obtaining raw, uncompressed images.
- Use Raspberry PI supported camera modules.
- Employ a trained model for threat detection.
- Do not store any data, ensuring privacy.
- Dispose of audio capture after a certain time (e.g., a day).
- Avoid being an attendance tracker; names are not necessary, just images.
- Update the model annually using reference images without storing them.
- Ensure privacy by design, not just by default.
- Consider Air Gapping Concept for enhanced security.
- Implement License Plate Recorders (LPRs).
- Explore day and night timer versions for cameras (infrared and regular).
- Use 2FA with Bluetooth and Wifi alongside facial recognition.

## Design

- Use templates from Amazon for fake security camera modules to save costs.

## Microphone

- Avoid obstructions near microphones.
- Use condenser mics for long-range audio capture.
- Include two microphones, each with a 180-degree range.
- Capture raw audio data without sound filters.
- Ensure high fidelity and bitrate for audio capture.
- Utilize stereoscopic mics for directional audio capture.
- Reference "ShotSpotter" published paper for insights.
- Distinguish between various sounds, including gunshots and similar noises.

## Camera

- Consider using ESP32CAM and USB repeater 4k webcams.
- Reference Raspberry Pi Documentation for camera options.
- Explore various camera models available on Amazon.

## Motherboard

- Options include NanoITX, NUKs Intel AMD, and Nanocontroller.
- Consider using USB Accelerator | Coral for machine learning acceleration.
- Explore Raspberry Pi 4 Model B options.

## Miscellaneous

- Ensure a robust battery backup system.
- Maintain a constant Ethernet connection with backup.
- Emphasize security and edge network connectivity.
