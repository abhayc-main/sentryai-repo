# AI-Based School Security System Using Facial and Audio Recognition

## Abstract

The current state of school security presents several challenges, including the risk of school shootings, privacy and security concerns, the presence of unwanted individuals on campus, and the critical task of ensuring the safety of children. Incidents of unauthorized access by individuals with malicious intent pose a significant threat to the well-being of students and staff. Existing security measures may be insufficient to detect and respond promptly to such situations, potentially leading to harmful consequences. This project aims to address these challenges by developing an advanced AI-driven security system that leverages facial and audio recognition technologies to enhance proactive threat detection and create a safe learning environment.

The AI model focuses on entrance monitoring using a network of strategically positioned cameras. It utilizes computer vision techniques, specifically face recognition algorithms, to identify individuals entering the premises. By comparing captured images with a database of authorized personnel, the system can determine the presence of unauthorized users and issue immediate alerts to the school administration. This capability significantly enhances security measures and allows for proactive measures to be taken when unauthorized access is detected.

Furthermore, the system incorporates a custom-developed algorithm for gunshot recognition. By analyzing the audio data captured by the cameras, the algorithm can identify distinct acoustic patterns associated with gunshots. In the event of a gunshot, the system triggers an immediate alert, notifying both the school administration and local law enforcement agencies. This rapid response enables swift action to be taken, potentially minimizing harm and ensuring the safety of students and staff.

The proposed AI model aims to revolutionize security measures within educational environments by providing real-time monitoring, threat detection, and timely alerts. It not only improves overall security but also enhances emergency response capabilities. Through the integration of advanced computer vision and audio analysis techniques, this project offers a comprehensive solution for maintaining a safe and secure learning environment. By addressing the challenges of school shootings, privacy concerns, unwanted individuals on campus, and child safety, the AI-based security system aims to ensure the well-being of students and staff.
