This document outlines the development timeline and essential elements for a project focused on predicting prospective mass shooting incidents using an ML-Powered Risk Assessment System. The project includes stages from research and development to implementing the final product into the SafeGate system and launching a pilot program. Critical components include collecting background information and identifying visual/behavioral characteristics of potential shooters, as well as understanding the impact of different environments.

## Development Timeline

1. **Complete Algorithm**: Development of the core machine learning algorithm.
2. **R&D**: Research and development phase for the overall system.
3. **Complete UI**: Design and finalize the user interface.
4. **Complete 3-D Printed Models**: Production of 3D models for the prototype.
5. **Create Physical Prototype**: Assembly of the first physical prototype.
6. **Start Research**: Initial phase involving data gathering and analysis for machine learning model.
7. **Complete Research Paper**: Finalization of the research paper.
8. **Implement into SafeGate**: Integration of the system into SafeGate.
9. **Pilot Program**: Launch of the pilot program in September.
